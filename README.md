# research

This repo contains a list of known security exploits and misconfigurations for various systems / software produced by BeyondTrust's research team.
The repo aims to provide automated scripts to setup and then demonstrate how each exploit / misconfiguration can be used.
This is designed to make BeyondTrust's research reproducible, so exploits can be better understood and recreated by a wider audience.
The root level folders are organized into 'domains' with subfolders containing specific exploits within that domain.

## exploits

- `entra` - Entra ID / Azure Active Directory 
    - `apps` - security misconfigurations that revolve around highly privileged apps in Entra
